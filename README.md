    <h2>Comparison: Python Visualization vs. ReactJS for the Web</h2>
    <p>Python offers robust libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, while ReactJS with <code>react-chartjs-2</code> integration provides a seamless way to create interactive charts in web applications. React's component-based structure and Chart.js integration enhance interactivity and responsiveness.</p>
